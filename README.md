# TartanHacks Project 2025: Promblematic
###Team: Morgan and Austin
Problematic is an application aimed to help elementary students practice their math skills by adjusting question difficulty based on emotional responses to questions detected through the student's webcam. In the future we hope to add functionality for other various subjects.
