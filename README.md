# TartanHacks Project 2025: Promblematic
### Team: Morgan and Austin
Problematic is an application aimed to help elementary school students practice their math skills by adjusting question difficulty based on emotional responses to questions detected through the student's webcam. In the future we hope to add functionality for other various subjects and more difficult math skills.

## Introduction

It is well known that current students have been having difficulty focusing and manging their emotions in school more than ever before. With problematic, students will get tailored questions based on their emotions as well as motivational encouragment from a fictonal character Hooter! Feeling frustrated? Hooter will let you know it is ok to feel that way and offer you a question at an easier level. Feeling happy? Hooter will congratulate you on how well you are doing and offer you a more challenging question. Current emotions supported include happiness, surprise, neutral emotion, anger, "saddness, disgust, as well as fear.
